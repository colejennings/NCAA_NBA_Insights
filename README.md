# Which Factors Are Most Determinant of Playoff Berths? An Analysis of Men's NCAA Basketball and the NBA

## 1. Introduction
Our project analyses which factors play the largest roll in NBA teams making the playoffs and Men's NCAA teams making the March Madness Tournament. We use machine learning techniques to predict if a team will make the playoffs and to discover what factors are involved when a team does make it. We used python to create XGBoost Decision Trees for both the NBA and NCAA playoffs and compared their accuracies as well as feature importances.

### Libraries Used
